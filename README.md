# BTC Liquidation Heatmap (Binance + Discord Alerts)

This project provides a Jupyter Notebook that generates **BTCUSDT liquidation-style heatmaps** using Binance market data.  
It analyzes wick intensity, volume, EMA crossovers, and proximity to price, then highlights high-liquidity zones.  
The script also demonstrates how to send annotated charts and top liquidity levels to a Discord channel.
